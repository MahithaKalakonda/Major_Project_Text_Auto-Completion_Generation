Subject line for job application email:

What’s a suitable email title for a job application? You could go crazy and say, “I’m perfect for this job!!!” but that would be silly. Instead, the subject line for your job application email should be simple to read and easy to understand.

The traditional (and still best) approach is to state your name and the job you’re applying for (or a combination of that). Here are a few examples:

Your name – Application for (job name) – Reference

Application for (job name) – (your name) – Reference

Applying for a job probably is the best place to get creative, so stick to a simple subject line for your job application emails. 




Email greeting for job application:

Your email greeting should be polite and professional. Examples of that include:

Dear (an oldie, but a goodie!)

Hi

Hello

If you know the recruiter's name, then use it. People always love to receive emails addressed to them. One thing to avoid is the phrase “Dear Sir/Madam” or using formal titles such as Mr, Mrs, or Ms. We’ve got a whole world of possibilities, so it’s time we all moved on from traditional (old-fashioned) titles.




How to start a job application email:

First up, state the purpose of your email. 

I am applying for the post of (job name)

Doing this means the person understands what the message is about – which will save them time. Also, in many cases, the person receiving the email won’t be the recruiter, so they can file it away and share it with the person (or persons) who need to see it. 

After that, you’ll need to explain what you’ve included with the email (your resume, cover letter, and examples). It’s always worth providing at least a few positive sentences on the opportunity. Finally, you’ll need to include any requested information, such as salary expectations. 



Simple job application email sample:

This simple job application email sample can be cut, pasted, edited, and amended for pretty much any opportunity. It’s not exciting or innovative, but it provides a structured way to communicate the critical points you need to.

Email introduction for job application sample:

The previous email sample covered how to apply for a job, this one is similar, but it’s about introducing yourself to the recruiter. This introduction approach is a great way to make a personal connection and can work well for several situations.

Job application status email sample:

We’re clear that you should always ask for details on the next steps in the recruitment process, but as we all know, real life doesn’t always follow rigid plans.

Kind regards,

(Your name)



Withdraw the job application email sample:

Yes, there are some occasions when you might need to withdraw a job application, in most cases because you’ve got another job.

You don’t need to explain why you’re removing yourself from a recruitment process, but most people usually do (and we have in this withdraw job application email sample). 

Hi (Recipient's name),

I recently applied for the (job name) and would like to withdraw my application. 

Since applying for the position, I have (include some information here).

I wish you well in the recruitment process and hope you find a great candidate to fill the role.
